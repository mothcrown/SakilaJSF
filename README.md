## SakilaJSF

Merely playing around with JSF and [Primefaces](https://www.primefaces.org/) in order to build slightly more professional-looking sites than ever before! Also getting myself used to both DAO pattern and Markdown language because I want to be one of the cool kids some day.

#### Used dependencies  
 * javaee-web-api - _7.0_
 * mysql-connector-java - _6.0.6_
 * primefaces - _5.0_
 * slf4j-api - _1.7.21_
 * slf4j-log4j12-_1.7.21_
 * log4j - _1.2.17_

And that's pretty much all there is to it. Hope you have fun!
